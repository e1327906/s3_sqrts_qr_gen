#Seamless QR Ticketing System

#the "ticket type" typically refers to the fare category, such as adult, child, senior, or student.
#This determines the fare price based on the passenger's eligibility criteria. On the other hand,
#the "journey type" in an AFC system usually refers to the type of trip, such as single journey, return journey,
#or a pass for unlimited travel within a certain period. So, while the ticket type determines the fare category,
#the journey type specifies the type and duration of travel
